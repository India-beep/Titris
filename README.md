Embedded Systems 2 project
## Overview of project
Repository for an STM32 based games console.
## Project components
This project will use an STM32 B-L475E-IOT01A Discovery kit to develop code for various sensors on the board using I2C alongside adding in several devices which will be controlled via SPI. The result of this work will be a games console for which hardware will be produced so that all SPI devices can be seen functioning with the board.
## Code
The STM32 board's software will be produced using the STM32Cube IDE. In terms of the sensors being used on the board the gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, magnetometer, humidity and temperature. These sensors will be controlled using I2C. The additional devices that will be featured on the console are a display, joystick, SD card, audio output, I/O expander. For learning purposes these devices will be controlled via SPI.
## Future
Add lasers
